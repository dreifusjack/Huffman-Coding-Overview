# Huffman-Coding-Overview

This Java project implements the Huffman coding algorithm. The algorithm efficiently encodes and decodes data by assigning variable-length codes to different characters based on their frequency of occurrence.

## Features

- Efficient Huffman encoding and decoding of text data.
- Visualization of Huffman trees for better understanding of encoding process.
- Input/output functionality for text files.
